This is a conversion to Git of the `xapi` module from the XML:DB CVS repositiory
via `anonymous@a.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xmldb-org`.

The archived project and code can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmldb-org/


== Content
The API interfaces are what driver developers must implement when creating a
new driver and are the interfaces that applications are developed against.
Along with the interfaces a concrete DriverManager implementation is also
provides.
